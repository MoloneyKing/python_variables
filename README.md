# python_variables
What each data type represents:
Strings represent text, like names, sentences, etc. We use "" or '' . Integers represent whole numbers. Lists represent ordered groups of data in [] .

Good naming practices:
Names should be lowercase , use underscores _ for spaces. Avoid symbols. Give names that indicate the variable's purpose clearly.

Combining strings vs math:
Use + to concatenate strings: 'ice cream' + ' flavor' . Use +, -, *, / for math: 2 + 3

Assignment vs concatenation:
= is for assigning a value: x = 5

is for concatenating strings: x = 'ice' + ' cream'
Commas vs + for multiple variables:
Use + to concatenate strings and assign : x = 'choco' + 'late'.
Use , to assign multiple variables at once: x,y,z ='choco', 'vanilla','strawberry'

Printing:
Use print() to see a variable's value or type() to see its data type.

Syntax:
Be careful with capitalization, whitespace, indentation. Consistency helps readability.

Examples:
names = ['John', 'Sarah'] #list of strings
price = 5 #integer
item = 'Milk' #string
total = price *2 #math operation

Make concepts concrete with real-life examples like customer data, counts, etc.
Hope this breakdown of how I would cover these Python basics from your examples is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here are detailed step-by-step instructions for working through the Python code examples you provided:

Declare integer variables:
python
Copy
x = 22
y
This assigns 22 to x, an integer. y is undefined.

Declare string variables:
python
Copy
y = 'Minct chocolate chip'
type(y)  
y is now a string. Use type() to check the data type.

Combine strings with +:
python
Copy
Y = 'Mint Chocolate Chip'
print(Y)
Assign multiple variables:
python
Copy
x,y,z = 'Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Rocky Road'
Use lists and indices:
python
Copy
ice_cream = ['Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Rocky Road']  
x,y,z = ice_cream   
Access list elements with indices in [] .

Use different variable naming styles:
snake_case
camelCase
PascalCase
Avoid testvar
Concatenate strings:
python
Copy
x = 'ice Cream is my favourite'  
y =  ' ,'  
z = 'yup!'
print(x + y + z)
Perform math with variables:
python
Copy
x = 1
y = 2 
print(x + y)
Add, subtract, multiply and divide integers.

Follow these steps to work through and understand the Python syntax, variables, data types and operations in your code examples.
